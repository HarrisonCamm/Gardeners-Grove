### 1. Objectives of Code Review
- **Improve Code Quality**: Identify bugs, ensure adherence to coding standards, and improve the maintainability and readability of the code.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitate learning and sharing of new techniques and technologies among team members.
- **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain a consistent coding style across the entire codebase.

### 2. Scope of the Review
- All code contributions, regardless of size or complexity, must undergo review.
- Documentation and test code are also subject to review.

### 3. Code Review Process
- **Submission**: Developers should provide a clear description of changes, the reason for the changes, and any specific areas where feedback is sought.
- **Assignment**: Reviews should be assigned to individuals during standups.
- **Review Timeframe**: Small changes might have a 24-hour review period, while larger changes could have up to 72 hours.

### 4. Review Criteria
- [ ] **Correctness**: Verify that the code functions as intended and fulfills its requirements.
- [ ] **Readability**: Ensure the code is easy to read and understand for someone not familiar with the specific task.
- [ ] **Performance**: Check for any potential performance issues.
- [ ] **Security**: Identify any security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Testing**: Ensure adequate tests are included and that existing tests are not negatively affected.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Verify that all new features or changes are properly documented. E.g. in a commit message, in the README, in the wiki, etc
- [ ] **Code Artifacts**: Ensure debugging code and irrelevant files are removed.

### 5. Conduct During Reviews
- **Constructive Feedback**: Comments should be constructive and focused on the code, not the individual.
- **Respectful Communication**: Maintain a respectful tone in all interactions.
- **Timely Responses**: Both reviewers and authors should respond promptly to questions and comments.
